<p>Whiffet, Skiffet and Skud were three little red squirrels who lived
with their father and mother in a tiny brown house in the old chestnut
tree. First, I must tell you how the Squirrel family came to live in
this dear little house. You see it happened this way. Father and
Mother Squirrel started out very early one morning in the spring, to
hunt a new home as they did not feel safe any longer living under the
old pine stump, with the children getting large enough to run about.
They both scampered up the old chestnut tree at the back of the farm
house to see if they could find a nice deep hollow that would make a
safe home for their little ones. When Mother Squirrel had gone about
half way up the tree trunk, and as she climbed around a big limb, she
almost bumped her head against what seemed to be a brownish wall.
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-008.png" alt="" title="" /> She
peeped around the corner of the brownish wall and what do you suppose
she saw? She held her breath in rapture for there before her bright
little eyes sat the cutest little brown house resting right on the big
limb. It was far more wonderful than any home that she had ever
dreamed of. It had a sloping red roof and two little round doors. A
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-009.png" alt="" title="" />
good sized porch jutted out in front and each little door was several
inches above the porch. Mother Squirrel very cautiously placed her two
front feet on the porch and listened intently but all was very quiet.
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-010a.png" alt="" title="" />
Of course the folks who owned the house might be still asleep or they
might be away. She crept quietly to the first little round door and
peeped in. She saw a cute little room entirely empty. &#8220;The family must
be away&#8221; she thought. Boldly she peeped in through the second little
door and saw another cute little room just like the first and also
empty. Then she walked in and explored both rooms and found a sort of
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-010b.png" alt="" title="" />
cubby hole closet at the back of each. &#8220;What a fine place for storing
nuts,&#8221; said Mother Squirrel to herself, &#8220;but it would be much handier
with a door between the two rooms.&#8221; Then she walked out on the porch
and looked around. The little house was shut in almost completely by
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-011a.png" alt="" title="" />
the thick green leaves except for a patch of blue sky that showed
above the roof. &#8220;I wonder who this little house belongs to&#8221; thought
Mother Squirrel to herself with an envious sigh. Just then she looked
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-011b.png" alt="" title="" />
up at the patch of blue sky and her bright eyes caught sight of a
small sign on the peak of the roof which she had not noticed before.
On the sign were printed the words &#8220;FOR RENT&#8221; in bright red letters.</p>

<p>When Mother Squirrel saw the sign &#8220;FOR RENT&#8221; she nearly fell backwards
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-012a.png" alt="" title="" />
off the porch in her joy and excitement. She began to chatter and
scream in a loud shrill voice which brought her husband scampering to
the spot at top speed. Father Squirrel was quite as excited and
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-012b.png" alt="" title="" />
delighted over the house as was his wife. &#8220;It was surely meant for us&#8221;
he said; &#8220;we&#8217;ll move in at once. You&#8217;d better stay here, my dear, in
case anyone should come along while I go back to the old stump for the
children and our things. I had better get the moving done before many
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-013.png" alt="" title="" />
people are out.&#8221; Off he scampered and Mother Squirrel began at once to
plan her housekeeping arrangements and started to gnaw a door between
the two rooms with her sharp little teeth. As she was working busily
at her task a shadow fell across the door and she heard a strange
chirping voice say: &#8220;My love, I am sure this is just the place we&#8217;ve
been looking for.&#8221; Her heart began to beat violently with alarm.
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-015.png" alt="" title="" />
Peeping through the door she saw two large fat Newly-wed Robins
standing on the porch in an affectionate attitude gazing admiringly up
at the house. &#8220;The nerve of some people&#8221; thought Mother Squirrel,
shaking with indignation. &#8220;They seem to think it&#8217;s a bird house. It&#8217;s
that &#8216;FOR RENT&#8217; sign. The idea of their talking about our house like
that! But I&#8217;ll fix <i>them</i>.&#8221; Mother Squirrel poked her head out of
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-016.png" alt="" title="" />
the little round door very suddenly and glaring with a very fierce
expression, she exclaimed in a loud voice: &#8220;THE CAT&#8217;S COMING&#8221;!</p>

<p><img class="figleft" src="images/illus-017.png" alt="" title="" />
The Newly-wed Robins both turned very pale and flew&mdash;I think they&#8217;re
flying yet. Mother Squirrel chuckled to herself but decided to take no
more risks so she climbed up the roof and took down the &#8220;FOR RENT&#8221;
sign.</p>

<p><img class="figright" src="images/illus-019.png" alt="" title="" />
Soon Father Squirrel and the children Whiffet, Skiffet and Skud, each
carrying a bag came scampering up the tree trunk. Mother Squirrel made
them nearly die laughing when she told them how she had frightened the
Newly-wed Robins.</p>

<p>Then Father Squirrel turned the &#8220;FOR RENT&#8221; sign over and painted on
the other side the words &#8220;NO TRESPASSING&#8221; and placed it on the corner
of the porch.</p>

<p><img class="figleft" src="images/illus-020a.png" alt="" title="" />This is how the Squirrel family found their new home but I will tell
you something that they do not even suspect. The little brown house is
a bird house built by Tom the farmer&#8217;s son for his little sister
Polly.</p>

<p><img class="figright" src="images/illus-020b.png" alt="" title="" />The
thickening leaves had hidden it from view and little Polly had
forgotten all about it.</p>

<p>Whiffet, Skiffet and Skud led a jolly life in the old chestnut tree.
They played from the topmost branch to the lowest limb but Mother
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-021.png" alt="" title="" />Squirrel would not let them go down the tree trunk to the ground for
fear of cats. Whiffet Squirrel the tiniest of the three could think of
more mischief than her two big brothers Skiffet and Skud put together.
She was not afraid of anything and was always bossing her brothers and
leading them into trouble.</p>

<p>One morning early she ran out on the large limb on which the little
brown house rested and found that it almost reached to one of the
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-022.png" alt="" title="" />windows
of the farmhouse. Peeping in the window she saw a pretty
little girl asleep in a small white bed. She leaped lightly to the
window-sill and looked around her. In one corner of the room she saw
many toys and dolls of every description, but the thing that attracted
her the most was a dear little doll&#8217;s trunk. It was standing at the
foot of the doll&#8217;s bed. &#8220;Just the right size for a squirrel&#8221; she
thought to herself. Just then Polly turned over in her sleep and
Whiffet scampered up the limb and back home as fast as she could run.
Of course she told Skiffet and Skud all about what she had seen and
she began to plan right away how they could get the little trunk. Yes
I will have to confess that they sometimes took things which did not
belong to them but as they were only squirrels no one had ever told
them any better.</p>

<p>Needless to say Whiffet kept her plan a secret as she knew that Mother
Squirrel would never consent. The following morning, just after
daylight, as soon as Father and Mother Squirrel had started out to
hunt their food for the day, the three little squirrels, Whiffet
leading the way, crept softly down the limb to the window-sill.
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-024.png" alt="" title="" />The
little trunk was standing in the same place and Polly was sleeping
soundly. A chair stood beneath the window and they leaped to the chair
seat then to the floor and crept softly toward the trunk. Whiffet as
usual bossed her brothers and made them each take a handle of the
trunk and carry it across the floor to the chair. Skiffet then climbed
to the chair seat and reached down and pulled valiantly at his end of
the trunk while
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-025.png" alt="" title="" />
Skud pushed from below. It was pretty heavy but they
got it safely to the chair seat. They had to be very careful about
making a noise as the window was near Polly&#8217;s bed. Next Skiffet
climbed to the window sill and pulled again while Skud boosted from
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-026a.png" alt="" title="" />
below. It was almost up when Skiffet&#8217;s foot slipped and he fell over
backwards losing his hold of the trunk; down it fell to the floor with
a loud bump. The little squirrels trembled with fear thinking that the
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-026b.png" alt="" title="" />
noise would awaken Polly but she only turned on her other side, and in
a few minutes they started to lift the trunk again. This time they
were more careful. They succeeded in getting it safely to the window
sill, but to hoist it to the tree branch was too risky a feat for them
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-027.png" alt="" title="" />
to try, so Whiffet decided to open the trunk and see what was inside.
She lifted up the lid very softly and found that it contained enough
pretty clothes for a whole doll family. In one of the trays was a
doll&#8217;s tiny white hand mirror, comb, brush and powder puff. Whiffet
was so taken up with these things she nearly forgot everything else,
but Skiffet reminded her that they had better carry the doll&#8217;s clothes
home at once as it was getting late and Polly might wake up any
minute.</p>

<p><img class="figright" src="images/illus-028.png" alt="" title="" />They had to make several trips but at last the trunk was emptied; they
shut down the lid and left it standing on the window sill. There was
much excitement over the new clothes and Father and Mother Squirrel
were as delighted as the children. I wish you could have seen the
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-030.png" alt="" title="" />
Squirrel family all dressed up in their finery. Skiffet fell in love
with a cunning red sweater, and Skud took possession of a tiny pair of
blue overalls.</p>

<p><img class="figright" src="images/illus-031.png" alt="" title="" />As for Whiffet she became very vain. She looked into the mirror every
day and powdered her nose regularly. She was very proud of a pale blue
evening dress which she found in the bottom of the little trunk, and
with slippers to match, her bliss was complete.</p>

<p>Two or three days later little Polly went to her doll&#8217;s trunk to get a
dress that she wanted and was very much surprised to find the trunk
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-032.png" alt="" title="" />entirely empty. She hunted everywhere but not a single one of the
things could she find. Polly felt very badly at the loss of her doll&#8217;s
clothes but especially missed the doll&#8217;s toilet articles as they were
the only ones she had. The mystery was not solved until one day late
in the month of October, when the leaves began to fall. Tom was
looking up in the chestnut tree when he caught a glimpse of the bird
house. &#8220;I wonder if any birds did use it&#8221; thought Tom. He climbed up
and peeped in the little round doors. The two little cubby holes at
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-033.png" alt="" title="" />
the back were full of chestnuts and in a corner of each room lay a
pile of doll&#8217;s clothes. &#8220;Oh Polly,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;come here quick; I&#8217;ve
found out who stole your doll&#8217;s clothes. It&#8217;s the squirrels.&#8221; Polly
came running; with Tom&#8217;s help she climbed the tree and peeped into the
<img class="figleft" src="images/illus-034.png" alt="" title="" />
house. (Of course the Squirrel family were all out walking when this
happened). &#8220;Did you ever&#8221; she cried. &#8220;The mischievous little rascals.
What do you suppose they wanted them for?&#8221; She reached her little hand
through the &#8220;bedroom&#8221; door and picked up a pile of the doll&#8217;s clothes.
Underneath she found the little mirror, brush, comb, and powder puff
where Whiffet had carefully hidden them. Polly was delighted to find
<img class="figright" src="images/illus-035.png" alt="" title="" />
her treasures. &#8220;I will take these home,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I will leave
the doll&#8217;s clothes, for no doll would care to wear them now.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;d
better climb down&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;for the squirrels can&#8217;t be far away and
we don&#8217;t want to scare them off.&#8221; &#8220;I wonder what became of the &#8216;FOR
RENT&#8217; sign,&#8221; said Polly. Just then a big red squirrel came scolding
and chattering down the tree trunk towards them. (It was Father
Squirrel). Tom and Polly climbed down quickly.</p>

<p><img class="figright" src="images/illus-037.png" alt="" title="" />That
night when Whiffet went to look for her mirror and powder puff
she exclaimed angrily, stamping her little blue slippered foot, &#8220;the
nerve of some people.&#8221;</p>

<p>So now Whiffet has to go without powdering her nose, and she can&#8217;t
tell when her hat is on straight for she has no mirror. Skiffet and
Skud have left off combing their top &#8220;Fur&#8221; as they have no comb or
brush, but I&#8217;m sure that Polly&#8217;s doll is very glad indeed to get her
own tiny things again.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
